Starting Board Configuration:
- 3x3 grid, all cells are empty.
- No holes in the board.
- Red player's turn to move.

Highest Flip Num Steps:
1. The simplest strategy checks the available cells in the board.
2. Since the board is empty, all cells are open for play.
3. According to the HighestFlipNum strategy, Red will look for which of their cards will flip the
most cards on the board at any legal position (open and not a hole).
4. Since all cells are open and there are no holes, the default move will occur and Red will play
to (0, 0) with their first card in hand.

Mock Relation:
- These steps mirror what occurs in the DefaultTriosMock.
